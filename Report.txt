Implementation - James // I'll try and get this done quick so you can finish your's Chris
Our new malloc function used the next fit allocation algorithm on an array of memory. We first allocate the entire array to reserve it for our program, and we initialize all the memory to empty. 
Whenever we are allocating memory to a process, we look through the array (from where we last left off) and keep looking until we find enough contiguous memory for the process. Once we find the contiguous memory we fill it and allow the process to run.
